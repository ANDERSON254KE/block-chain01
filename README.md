Getting Started with Your React App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing an easy setup for React projects.

Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can use the following commands:

`npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page will auto-reload if you make edits, and any lint errors will appear in the console.

 `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, see [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production, optimizing files for best performance, and outputs them to the `build` folder.

The production build is minified, and filenames include hashes for efficient caching.\
Your app will be ready for deployment after this step.

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for further information.

 `npm run eject`

> Note:** This action is irreversible. Once you `eject`, you cannot return to the default configuration.

Running `eject` copies the configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, allowing you full control over them. This is useful for custom configurations but is generally not recommended unless needed.

Most users will not need to use `eject`, as Create React Appâ€™s default configuration covers common requirements.
